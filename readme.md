## Project description

This template has been created to enable the creation and versioning of Unity engine projects. This template features a pre-configured .gitignore and .gitattributes to ensure the project is correctly stored on our GIT server.

## Starting an Unity project

Before using this template, ensure you have:

* Installed a GIT client on your machine. (We recommend [Fork](https://git-fork.com/))
* Downloaded the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/products) on your machine.
* Downloaded the Unity engine editor version currently supported. (Please see the [GA software list](https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/ga-software-list) for further information on the currently supported version)

## Instructions for using the Unity Engine Template

Get started with this template by clicking 'Use This Template' or by selecting it in the options on the repo creation page.

### Using the template

As the template is mostly pre configured you only need to apply minimal setup to best utilise this template.

1. Make sure when creating your Unity Engine project to put all the source  files in the project folder into the 'Game' folder in the repo.
2. Ensure the .gitignore and .gitattributes files are present in the same folder as the project files.
